## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
### Project two is about creating a Thermostat prototype using the Raspberry Pi hardware architecture with several peripherals such as the AHT20 temperature sensor(I2C), two LED lights, and three buttons for SysTec's CEO. It was my job to write interface software to control hardware components using the Python programming language, analyze fundamental considerations regarding hardware architecture design and their impact on application performance, and recommend and justify emerging systems architectures and technologies based on business requirements. 

## What did you do particularly well?
### I did particularly well in efficiently assembling the compoenenting for the prototype as well as devloping interface software using the Python programming language while following industry standard best practices. 

## Where could you improve?
### I could improve upon my state machine diagram that showcases real-time system design. I think I could also improve upon my understanding on embedded systems by working on additional embedded system projects and by studying prototypes of other hardware architect designers.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
### The resources for my support network include:
#### 1. Raspberry Pi documentation and embeddes systems reference manual.
#### 2. Open source hardware projects for comparison.
#### 3. Industry forums such as Stack Overflow and embedded system communities. 

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
### The skill of diagnosing, debugging, and troubleshooting gained in this course is transferrable towards other projects and course work.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
### I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following OOP principles and by following industry standard best practices while writing the code for the Thermostat prototype.
